## Geo-Location on Clients and Servers

*Note: This description is too big for a single exam-question. It will be divided up into separate questions for the exam*  
In this period we will refresh our knowledge related to React Native, mainly focusing on geo-location features. We will introduce GeoJSON, and how to use it with plain JavaScript and with MongoDB. We will continue with the mini project

# Period-3 - Exam Preparation Questions

## Explain and demonstrate basic Geo-JSON, involving as a minimum, Points and Polygons

## Explain and demonstrate ways to create Geo-JSON test data

## Explain the typical order of longitude and latitude used by Server Side API’s and Client Side API’s

## Explain and demonstrate a REST API that implements geo-features, using a relevant geo-library and plain JavaScript

## Explain and demonstrate a REST API that implements geo-features, using Mongodb’s geospatial queries and indexes.

## Explain and demonstrate a React Native Client that uses geo-components (Location, MapView, etc.)

## Demonstrate both server and client-side, of the geo-related parts of your implementation of the mini project
